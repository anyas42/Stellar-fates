## ✨ Cosmic Journey

Stellar Fates is a cosmic tarot-inspired experience that blends real space history with symbolic storytelling. Each time you visit, you’re invited to enter a date — like your birthday or a random moment — and receive a three-card “fate reading” that reveals actual astronomical events that occurred on or near that day.

Each card represents a cosmic archetype:

- **The Awakening** – discoveries and beginnings  
- **The Eclipse** – challenges and failures  
- **The Echo** – legacies and lasting impact  

With each draw, you’ll uncover poetic interpretations, visuals, and a deeper sense of connection to the universe. Beyond readings, the experience includes mini-games and ambient interactions to make space history feel alive, personal, and unforgettable.
